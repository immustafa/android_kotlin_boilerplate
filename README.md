* [Architecture][1] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    * [Lifecycles][2] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
    * [Navigation][3] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
    * [ViewModel][4] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
    * [Coroutines][5] - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
